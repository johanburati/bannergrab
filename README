Bannergrab - README
===================

1. Overview

   Bannergrab is a simple tool, designed to collect information
   from network services. It can do this using two different
   methods; grab the connection banners and send triggers and
   collect the responses. Bannergrab defaults to sending
   triggers.

   Additionally, Bannergrab supports SSL-based services and
   will report on SSL connection characteristics.


2. Requirements

   * The GNU C Compiler (to compile it)
   * OpenSSL libraries (to connect to SSL-based services)


3. Compiling from source

   gcc -lssl -o bannergrab bannergrab.c

   To compile without OpenSSL support...

   gcc -DNOSSL -o bannergrab bannergrab.c


4. Usage

   Bannergrab provides online help using the standard
   --help command option. However, in its simplist form
   to grab a banner from a service:

   bannergrab <ip address> <port>


5. Triggers

   I like software that is open, you can read my source
   to discover exactly how bannergrab sends triggers to
   services. However, for those of you that do not want
   to go through the code here is a brief description.

   This is of course dependant on the user not simply
   disabling triggers.

   Bannergrab will look at the port number that the
   is being used and try to match it to a trigger/set of
   triggers. It does NOT probe the service to determine
   this. If a trigger is found for that port then it
   will use that, otherwise it will use the default one.

   The triggers will be sent one after another and the
   response captured. It is as simple as that.

   The triggers do the following:

   FTP
     * Asks for help.
     * Attempts to login anonymously.
     * Quits.

   SMTP
     * Says Hello.
     * Asks for help.
     * Attempts to VRFY postmaster.
     * Attempts to VRFY bannergrab123.
     * Attempts to EXPN postmaster.
     * Quits.

   Finger
     * Attempts to enumerate a few users.

   HTTP(S)
     * Asks for OPTIONS.

   POP2/3
     * Quits.

   NNTP
     * Asks for HELP.
     * Lists the newsgroups.
     * Quits.

   FW1 Admin
     * Attempts to list IPs.

   LDAP(S)
     * Performs an Anonymous bind.
     * Gets a list of base Distinguished
       Names (DN).

   MSSQL
     * Attempts a login using BannerGrab
       user.

   MySQL
     * Waits longer for a MySQL response.

   Discard/Echo
     * Send echo.

   Chargen/Daytime/QOTD/SSH/VMWare/Printer
     * Send nothing.

   NTP
     * Queries time
     * Queries read list
     * Queries peers

   SNMP
     * Sends "public" community string
     * Sends "private" community string

   NetBIOS Name Service
     * Name query

   ALL OTHERS (Default)
     * Send OPTIONS and ask for HELP.
